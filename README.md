Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology can transfer electrical energy from a transmitter to a receiver wirelessly. WPT has been
achieved through the affordable inductive coupling between two coils named a transmitter and a receiver coil. Transmitter coils
are located underneath the road, and receiver coils are installed in the EV.Through WPT, the system achieves an impressive 90%
energy transfer efficiency, providing the EV with a rapid charging capability of up to 120 kW, significantly reducing charging
times and enhancing the overall user experience.
